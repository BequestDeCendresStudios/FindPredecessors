# FindPredecessors
A relatively simple algorithm for finding predecessor technology given an input vector of A.

## Use Case
Suppose you have a friend correcting you about a historical fact at a Steampunk convention, about the origins of the guillotine.

This allows you to research predessor technology of the same family group, and figure out the probability that it is indeed a predessor technology.

## Context
A revolutionary in Revolutionary France is arguing with a colleage about the origins of the national razor. He remarks that the first machine dates back to the Rennaissance era, and that the reason you never here about the case is because the Workers Revolt vampire princess was natoriously hard to pin down, and needed gravity to do the trick. This algorithm validates assertions made that something is indeed a precursor based on three possible parent groups.

It sort of takes the fun out of retrofuturism though.
